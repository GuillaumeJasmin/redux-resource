# Migrating

This guide covers a migration from `redux-resource-action-creators@1.x` to `redux-resource-action-creators@2.0.0`.

### Upgrade to Redux Resource v3.0.0

You must upgrade to `redux-resource@3.0.0` to use `redux-resource-action-creators@2.0.0`.

### Replace calls to `.null()` with `.idle()`

In Redux Resource v3, the `NULL` request status has been renamed to `IDLE`, and this method has
been updated to reflect that change.

### That's all!

That should do it.
