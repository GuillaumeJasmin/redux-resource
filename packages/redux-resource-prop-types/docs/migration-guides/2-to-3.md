# Migrating

This guide covers a migration from `redux-resource-prop-types@2.x` to `redux-resource-prop-types@3.0.0`.

v3.0.0 of `redux-resource-prop-types` introduced several breaking changes. The philosophy behind
v3.0.0 is that we want to provide you with better primitive prop types to build more robust
prop types.

The v2 prop types were very basic, and consequently didn't do a very good at protecting you from
bugs. Using the new prop types in v3, you can have much more confidence that the prop types
that you build are actually helping you find issues with your props.

### New Prop Types

Familiarize yourself with the new prop types. You'll want to use these to build new, better
prop types.

You can read about them on
[the documentation page](https://redux-resource.js.org/docs/extras/redux-resource-prop-types.html).

### Removed Prop Types

#### `resourceIdsPropType`

You can instead use the new prop type, `idPropType`, like so:

```js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { idPropType } from 'redux-resource-prop-types';

PropTypes.arrayOf(idPropType);
```

#### `resourcesPropType`

If you'd like to continue using the old version, here's the code:

```js
const resourcesPropType = PropTypes.arrayOf(
  PropTypes.shape({
    id: PropTypes.oneOfType([
      PropTypes.string,
      PropTypes.number,
    ])
  })
);
```

Instead, we recommend using the new `resourcePropType` (note that that name is singular!) to create
a more robust prop type for your resources. Then, you can use that prop type to build an array prop
type:

```js
const booksPropType = PropTypes.arrayOf(bookPropType);
```

#### `slicePropType`

If you'd like to continue using the old version in your application, then you can copy and paste this
code into your application:

```js
const slicePropType = PropTypes.shape({
  resources: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  meta: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  requests: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  lists: PropTypes.object.isRequired
});
```

However, we recommend building a more robust prop type, such as:

```js
import { idsPropType } from 'redux-resource-prop-types';

const booksSlicePropType = PropTypes.shape({
  resources: PropTypes.objectOf(booksPropType).isRequired,
  meta: PropTypes.objectOf(booksMetaPropType).isRequired,
  requests: PropType.objectOf(booksRequestPropType).isRequired,
  lists: PropType.objectOf(idsPropType).isRequired,
  customStuff: myCustomPropType,
  // ...and so on
});
```
