# Migrating

This guide documents migration from `redux-resource-xhr@3.x` to `redux-resource-xhr@4.0.0`.

### Upgrade to Redux Resource v3.0.0

You must upgrade to `redux-resource@3.0.0` to use `redux-resource-xhr@4.0.0`.

### Other Changes

Although there are breaking changes between v3.x and v4.0, they are unlikely to affect you.
The list of breaking changes is as follows:

*HTTP status codes are set on requests objects by default**

Previously, you needed to include the HTTP Status Codes plugin
for status codes to be stored on /docs/requests/request-objects.md. This happens
automatically now.

**HTTP status codes are no longer wiped when a request becomes pending**

Previously, the HTTP status codes would be reset to `0` when a request becomes pending. Now,
the status code remains the same value that it was when the last successful request
occurred.

This behavior is more useful when developing interfaces that use the status codes to
provide feedback to users.
