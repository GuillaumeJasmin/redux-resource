A tiny but powerful system for managing 'resources': data that is persisted to
remote servers.

âœ“ Removes nearly all "boilerplate" code for remotely-stored data  
âœ“ Tracks the status (pending, failed, success, etc.) of _every_ request  
âœ“ Encourages [normalized state](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html)  
âœ“ Works well with APIs that adhere to standardized formats, such as JSON API  
âœ“ Works well with APIs that don't adhere to standardized formats, too  
âœ“ Integrates well with lots of technologies: HTTP, GRPC, streams, redux-observable, redux-saga, and more    
âœ“ Microscopic file size (2kb gzipped!)

### Installation

To install the latest stable version:

```
npm install --save resourceful-redux
```

### Documentation

View the documentation at
**[resourceful-redux.js.org â‡—](https://resourceful-redux.js.org/)**.

### Quick Start

Follow this guide to get a taste of what it's like to work with Resourceful
Redux.

First, we set up our store with a "resource reducer," which is a reducer that
manages the state for one type of resource. In this guide, our reducer will
handle the data for our "books" resource.

```js
import { store, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { resourceReducer } from 'resourceful-redux';

const reducer = combineReducers({
  books: resourceReducer('books')
});

const store = createStore(reducer);
```

Once we have a store, we can start dispatching actions to it. In this example,
we initiate a request to read a book with an ID of 24, then follow it up with an
action representing success. There are two actions, because requests usually
occur over a network, and therefore take time to complete.

```js
import { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';
import store from './store';

// This action represents beginning the request to read a book with ID of 24. This
// may could represent the start of an HTTP request, for instance.
store.dispatch({
  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,
  resourceName: 'books',
  resources: [24]
});

// Later, when the request succeeds, we dispatch the success action.
store.dispatch({
  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,
  resourceName: 'books',
 Â // The `resources` list here is usually the response from an API call
 Â resources: [{
    id: 24,
    title: 'My Name is Red',
    releaseYear: 1998,
    author: 'Orhan Pamuk'
  }]
});
```

Later, in your view layer, you can access information about the status of
this request. When it succeeds, accessing the returned book is straightforward.

```js
import { getStatus } from 'resourceful-redux';
import store from './my-store';

const state = store.getState();
// The second argument to this method is a path into the state. This method
// protects you from needing to check for undefined values.
const readStatus = getStatus(store, 'books.meta.24.readStatus');

if (readStatus.pending) {
  console.log('The request is in flight.');
}

else if (readStatus.failed) {
  console.log('The request failed.');
}

else if (readStatus.succeeded) {
  const book = state.books.resources[24];

  console.log('The book was retrieved successfully, and here is the data:', book);
}
```

This is just a small sample of what it's like working with Resourceful Redux.

For a real-life webapp example that uses many more CRUD operations, check out
the **[zero-boilerplate-redux webapp â‡—](https://github.com/jmeas/zero-boilerplate-redux)**.
This example project uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), although
Resourceful Redux works well with any view layer.
