# Extensions

Extensions are optional bits of code that make working with Resourceful Redux
even better.

When you install the `resourceful-redux` npm package, we include all these
extensions as separate modules within that package. This means that if you don't
wish to use the extensions, they won't be included in your application's bundle.
But if you do decide to use them, it's easier in that you don't have to worry
about installing separate packages.
