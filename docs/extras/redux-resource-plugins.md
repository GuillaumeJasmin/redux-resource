These plugins can be used to augment the reducer returned by `resourceReducer`.
The plugins are a collection of common patterns that you may find yourself
needing when writing a CRUD application.

Do you find yourself using the same plugin over and over?

```

### Usage

This library is a collection of different plugins. Refer to their individual
documentation pages to learn more.

- [`reset`](reset-plugin.md): This plugin provides action types
  that let you reset the state of an entire slice. You can also pass a list to
  reset the state of just that list.

- [`includedResources`](included-resources-plugin.md): This plugin
  adds support for including multiple resource types into a single action for
  read requests. This can be useful if you're using GraphQL, JSON API, or normalizr.

- [`httpStatusCodes`](http-status-codes-plugin.md): Add this plugin
  to track the HTTP status codes associated with each request. The built-in
  reducer behavior doesn't provide any information specific to HTTP. What this
  means is that if a request fails, for instance, you won't be able to tell that
  it failed with a 404 response.

##### Deprecated Plugins

The following plugins are deprecated. There are built-in features that provide
the same functionality as these plugins.

- [`selection`](selection-plugin.md): This plugin allows you to
  maintain a list of "selected" resource IDs. If your interface displays a list
  of resources that the user can select to perform bulk operations on, then this
  might be useful to you.
