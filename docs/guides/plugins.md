# Plugins

Plugins are a feature that let you customize the behavior of the resource
reducer. Use plugins to:

- Add support for custom action types
- Add or change the way the reducer responds to the built-in action types

### Writing a Plugin

Writing a plugin is very similar to writing a reducer. Plugins are functions
that have the following signature: `(state, action, options)`, where `state` is
the current state, `action` is the action that was dispatched, and `options` are
the `options` that were passed into
[`resourceReducer`](../api-reference/resource-reducer.md).

A plugin must always return the new state.

Because a plugin is intended to be generic, you will often wrap your plugins
in a function that you call with the resource that the plugin is for. This
lets you scope the plugin to a specific resource. Otherwise, any time that you
fire a particular Action type, _all_ of the resources in your state tree would
be affected!

### Custom Action Types

Let's build a plugin that lets a user select resources from a list. The code
for this plugin looks like this:

```js
import { setResourceMeta } from 'resourceful-redux';
import myActionTypes from './my-action-types';

export default function(resourceName) {
  return function(state, action, options) {
    // Ignore actions that were dispatched for another resource type
    if (action.resourceName !== resourceName) {
      return state;
    }

    if (action.type === myActionTypes.SELECT_RESOURCES) {
      return {
        ...state,
        meta: setResourceMeta({
          resources: action.resources,
          meta: state.meta,
          newMeta: {
            selected: true
          },
          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta
        })
      };
    } else if (action.type === myActionTypes.UNSELECT_RESOURCES) {
      return {
        ...state,
        meta: setResourceMeta({
          resources: action.resources,
          meta: state.meta,
          newMeta: {
            selected: false
          },
          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta
        })
      };
    } else {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```

You would then use this plugin like so:

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { resourceReducer } from 'resourceful-redux';
import selectResources from './plugins/select-resources';

let store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    books: resourceReducer('books', {
      plugins: [
        selectResources('books')
      ]
    }),
  })
);
```

### Changing Built-In Action Type behavior

Plugins are run **after** the built-in reducer code runs, so you can write
plugins that affect the way the store behaves for certain action types.
In the following plugin, we set a property on the store anytime a successful
read occurs:

```js
export default function(resourceName) {
  return function(state, action, options) {
    // Only take action if the resource name of the Action matches the
    // resource this plugin is registered for
    if (action.resourceName !== resourceName) {
      return state;
    }

    if (action.type === 'READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEED') {
      return {
        ...state,
        readSucceeded: true
      };
    } else {
      return state;
    }
  };
}
```

A more useful example of this is if your API supports "compound documents",
where multiple types of resources can be returned at one time. You could
write plugins to support those endpoints.

### Best Practices

Because plugins are so similar to reducers, you can use a `switch` statement
and support multiple action types within each plugin. This is usually a
good thing, but be mindful of keeping each plugin limited to a single
responsibility.

For example, in the above example of a plugin for selecting resources, it
supports two Action types – one for selection, and one for deselection. This
plugin encapsulates that one responsibility, and it isn't responsible for any
other Action types.

We recommend having a plugin for each distinct responsibility.
