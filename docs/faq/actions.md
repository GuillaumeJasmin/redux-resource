# Actions

#### Are there Action Creators?

Not in the core library, but there is an
[Action Creators library](/docs/extensions/action-creators.md).

Developers have different preferences when it comes to making requests, so we
made this library easy to use with any request library that you choose. We've
had great success with the Action Creator library, but should you choose to
write your own, we have guides to help you.

Refer to the [CRUD Actions](/docs/guides/crud-actions.md) guide to learn more
about how to build your own action creator, or the four CRUD guides for examples
of action creators:

- [Reading resources](/docs/guides/reading-resources.md)
- [Updating resources](/docs/guides/reading-resources.md)
- [Creating resources](/docs/guides/reading-resources.md)
- [Deleting resources](/docs/guides/reading-resources.md)

#### Does Redux Resource require you to use a specific tool for making HTTP requests?

No, you can use any system for making requests that you'd like.

#### Should all Actions use a named requests?

Probably not.  We recommend using named requests when they provide you value. Two
common use cases for named requests are:

1. creating resources

2. multiple bulk reads of the same resource type on the same page

A handy rule of thumb for when to use named requests, as well as much more
information about named requests, can be found in
[the Named Requests guide](/docs/guides/named-requests.md#when-to-use-named-requests).
