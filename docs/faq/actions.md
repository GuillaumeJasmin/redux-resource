# Actions

#### Should all Actions have labels?

We recommend only using labels when they're necessary. The most common use case
we run into for using labels is having multiple bulk read requests of the same
resource on a page at once.

If using the label isn't providing value for a specific operation, then you
probably don't need to use one.
